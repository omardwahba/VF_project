        What Is Vertical Farming? Everything You Should Know About This
        Innovation
      </h1>
      <p>
        It’s no secret that the future of agriculture is concerning and needs a
        change. Overall, the population is growing at about 1 percent per year,
        even faster in some countries. Feeding this growing population is sure
        to be a challenge as time progresses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adding to the problem, current and former agricultural practices are
        incredibly harmful to the planet. Agriculture has been implicated as a
        driving cause of climate change, deforestation, and soil degradation.
        The problem is so significant that we’ve
        <span> lost a third of our arable land</span>
        over the past 40 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        We must find better ways of producing food for future generations.
        Fortunately, new farming technology, such as vertical agriculture,
        offers an excellent way to meet these challenges and produce the food
        needed for future generations.

      <h2>Advantages of Vertical Farming</h2>
      <div class="advantage">
        <h3>Optimum space usage</h3>
        <p>
          Traditional farming methods demand acres of plain and fertile land.
          However, that is not the prerequisite for vertical cultivation
          techniques. As already mentioned, this farming method uses stacks of
          vertically inclined surfaces to grow crops. Also, these crops can grow
          in all sorts of conditions and areas since they use non-soil mediums.
          Plus, they can prosper even under adverse climatic conditions and
          extremities.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="advantage">
        <h3>Reduced transportation cost</h3>
        <p>
          Urban location of vertical farms make their delivery points easily
          accessible. Unlike traditional farming, crop producers need not ship
          end-products across multiple countries and oceans. They can instead
          set up farms in areas close to their customer locations. It shortens
          the supply chain, thus reducing transportation charges and carbon
          footprint.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="advantage">
        <h3>Consistent and higher crop yield</h3>
        <p>
          Probably, the most advantageous feature of vertical farming is
          reliable crop production for 365 days as such farming techniques are
          independent of external factors like sunlight, seasons, water, and
          area, among others. Such consistent crop production also leads to an
          overall higher yield. Cropin's SmartFarm and SmartRisk are efficient
          solutions for digital farming to help farmers predict crop output
          accurately.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="advantage">
        <h3>Lower water usage</h3>
        <p>
          Since vertical farming involves hydroponic growing methods, it reduces
          water needs for irrigation. Moreover, the used water is utterly clean
          even after usage, making it recyclable for the next farming cycle. As
          a result, such farming methods use only 10% of the provided water.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="advantage">
        <h3>Zero agrochemical usage</h3>
        <p>
          Growing crops under controlled environmental conditions eliminates the
          entry of disease-causing pests or weeds. In turn, this reduces the
          crop protection products a farmer might need otherwise. As a result,
          the end-product also becomes safer for consumption, adding to food
          safety.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="advantage">
        <h3>Energy efficiency</h3>
        <p>
          Some vertical farms have in-built power generation units, which lower
          power consumption costs and help reduce carbon footprint.
          Additionally, other farms can get in touch with organizations
          employing renewable technologies to combine power and heat to produce
          enormous clean energy. Farms can also use the excess energy to power
          other business equipment or transfer it to their concerned power grid.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="advantage">
        <h3>Minimized occupational hazard</h3>
        <p>
          Besides being sustainable, vertical farming also reduces occupational
          risks associated with operating heavy farming equipment. Similarly,
          they need not deal with harmful agrochemicals and disease-causing
          microbes. This farming method also promotes biodiversity as it does
          not affect plants and animals in surrounding areas.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="advantage">
        <h3>Reduced labor costs</h3>
        <p>
          Vertical method of cultivation is almost entirely dependent on
          technology. Therefore, a farm adopting a completely-automated mode of
          operation will need a negligible human workforce. Overall lower labour
          costs help farmers enjoy a higher yield against reduced labour charge,
          thus maximising gains.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="advantages">
      <h2>Disadvanatge of Vertical Farming</h2>
      <div class="advantage">
        <h3>High technological dependency</h3>
        <p>
          Vertical farming is highly dependent on technology which requires
          farmers to invest heavily in diverse technologies and equipment to
          monitor moisture, lighting, temperature, and other parameters.
          However, failure of any one piece of equipment can disrupt the entire
          cultivation process, for the time being, thus minimizing produce.
          Also, several farming experts believe that our
          <span> modern-day agriculture technologies</span> are not advanced
          enough for the smooth operation of vertical farming.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="advantage">
        <h3>Reduced pollination</h3>
        <p>
          While farming under controlled environmental conditions prevents the
          undesirable entry of pests, it also hinders natural pollination by
          bees, butterflies, beetles, birds, and other pollinators. Here,
          farmers need to adopt manual pollination, which can be a costly and
          troublesome affair.
