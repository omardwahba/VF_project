        <p>
          Since indoor vertical farming and hydroponic technology is new to
          most, our partners tend to have a lot of questions about our process
          and products.

          <h3 class="custom-h3">What is vertical farming?</h3>
          <div>
            <p class="custom-p">
              Vertical farming is a type of controlled environment agriculture
              (CEA). Rather than traditional, soil-based farming, vertical
              farming grows and harvests crops on vertical shelves or towers. At
              Eden Green Technology, our microclimate technology and vertical
              hydroponic systems allow us to grow more than 200+ products
              consisting of leafy greens, cropping fruits and herbs every day of
              the year. Vertical farmers can grow the same amount of food
              compared to traditional methods, more consistently, with 99% less
              land, 98% less water and less than 3% food waste

            how big is a typical vertical greenhouse? how much produce can you
            grow?
          </h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              For a commercially viable production model, our vertical
              greenhouses are 62,500 sq ft (roughly 1.5 acres) and are
              deployable in urban, suburban, or rural environments. A 1.5 acre
              vertical farm can be harvested all year long, resulting in 11-13
              harvests a year (that’s 3x more than a traditional farm). Our
              standard greenhouse can yield 1.8 million pounds of produce (2.7
              million servings of nutritious leafy) greens a year.

          <h3 class="custom-h3">
            how are vertical greenhouses more sustaniable more than tradictional
            farms?
          </h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              We pride ourselves on designing modular greenhouses and leveraging
              our patented vertical vines that recycle water, rely heavily on
              natural sunlight, utilize 99% less land and 98% less water, and
              have very little need for any gas-powered machinery to grow,
              harvest, and ship. We do not use preservatives and our produce is
              non-GMO. Since our plants are harvested and in market within 48
              hours, their shelf life is longer, waste is minimal, and the risk
              of recall and food-borne illnesses is zero. We grow exactly what
              we need, and donate up to 10% of daily harvests to local nonprofit
              partners.

            what makes your vertical farming technology better than other indoor
            options?
          </h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              Our vertical greenhouse systems and patented microclimate
              technology is the next wave of vertical farming. We’ve made
              vertical farming more profitable, more sustainable and easy to
              scale. Other Vertical Farms: The majority of vertical farming
              companies use traditional flat tray technology, and will take
              2x-5x more capital investment to operate because of their reliance
              on 100% LED lighting and automation. We use 90% less light energy
              to produce the same yield. Other Greenhouses: Our greenhouse
              competitors, especially ones that are soil-based rather than
              hydroponic, have exponentially less yield volumes, slow-to-respond
              environmental controls, and lack crop flexibility. Our smart
              greenhouse systems can adjust to temperature changes in moments,
              rather than hours, and can all be controlled remotely.

          <h3 class="custom-h3">are hydroponic foods healthy?</h3>
          <div>
            <p class="custom-p">
              Due to our 48-hour harvest-to-shelf timeline, your locally-grown
              produce will not have taken the typical 9-13 days to travel from
              farm to market. Leafy greens can lose much of their nutritional
              value from pesticides, preservatives, and time it takes to pack,
              store, and ship to your local store. Our hydroponic produce is
              non-GMO and preservative-free. Our indoor setting protects our
              greens from the typical pests, and our 48-hour timeline results in
              more nutritional value and higher quality in flavor and texture,
              and overall, more delicious produce. Another benefit is our longer
              shelf life. These greens stay fresher longer, because our vertical
              farming model has eliminated the longer travel time and we harvest
              11-13 times more than a typical farm. Your customer will never
              have to eat an entire package of romaine in a few days, or waste
              spinach that has turned in less than a week after purchase.

          <h3 class="custom-h3">is hydroponic better than organic?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              Hydroponic produce is grown differently than organic produce. As
              of right now, only produce grown in soil can be considered
              organic. There is a national case being made to open the “USDA
              Organic” label up to hydroponic produce. Once that has been
              resolved, we hope to be one of the first hydroponic-based vertical
              farming companies to label their produce as organic. In the
              meantime, we like to say that we’re “better than organic” since
              our greens do not absorb soil contaminants that might exist in the
              land or from pests (birds, rodents, bugs, nearby cattle runoff,
              etc.) because they are grown in a consistent and highly controlled
              manner which preserves their nutritional value.

          <h3 class="custom-h3">does hydroponic food taste good</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              Yes! We are a bit biased, but with the right technology and expert
              growers, locally grown hydroponic produce is delicious. We've even
              converted some anti-kale people into kale lovers! Our technology
              is able to grow the best tasting produce because of our precise
              and responsive microclimate technology, along with our greenhouse
              managers and growers' expertise.

          <h3 class="custom-h3">can you reuse hydroponic water?</h3>
          <div>
            <p class="custom-p">
              Yes! Our systems reuse water again and again, meaning that after
              the initial setup, very little water is needed to keep the system
              running. Our closed loop systems filter outside water with
              powerful UV lighting and enrich it with the exact amount of
              nutrients every 90 seconds. Our water waste per year is less than
              what two US households waste in a year. Similar to other vertical
              farming solutions, our hydroponic farms use 98% less water than
              traditional farming methods.

          <h3 class="custom-h3">what are the advantage of hydroponics?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              Think about a future where nutritious, delicious, and fresh
              produce is locally accessible and affordable for every person.
              This vision is actually achievable when you can grow fruits and
              vegetables to their fullest potential with our vertical farms
              placed in food deserts. In countries where extreme weather (like
              frequent droughts or heavy rainy seasons), lack of water or arable
              land make traditional farming impossible, our approach to vertical
              farming gives people the opportunity to farm. Hydroponics is more
              efficient, sustainable and built to grow the healthiest of produce
              using 98% less water, 99% less land, and 100% natural sunlight.

            can two different crops be grown in one greenhouse?
          </h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              Yes, you can grow 200+ different types of leafy greens, herbs, and
              cropping fruits within one greenhouse. Each standard 1.5 acre
              greenhouse is split into up to 4 zones, depending on your
              production needs. Each zone's nutrients, water and air
              temperature, and humidity can be customized to the type of produce
              grown within them. That way you could grow tropical plants like
              basil, that need more humidity, in a zone right next to kale,
              without compromising on the quality or length of crop cycles.

              Our technology can create the perfect environment for 200+
              products to out-perform the competition. Plants such as leafy
              greens like spinach, romaine, or basil, or Asian greens like pak
              choi or joi choi are best for hydroponics. You can also grow
              peppers, tomatoes, and snap peas

          <h3 class="custom-h3">what cannot be grown hydroponically?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              We grow mostly leafy greens and herbs. While our technology is
              capable of growing berries and peppers, we do not grow tubers.
              What’s a tuber? A tuber is a plant where the underground part of
              the stem or rhizome is harvested and eaten. Our plant roots are in
              water 24/7 and that can cause tubers like onions, potatoes, and
              garlic to rot. The only proven way to grow potatoes hydroponically
              is by using aeroponics, which is not part of our growing method.
